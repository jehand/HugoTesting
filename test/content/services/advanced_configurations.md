The Advanced Configurations Division has core competencies in the CFD, FEM, loads prediction (static), subsonic systems level models (i.e., EDS models), rotorcraft systems level models, and UAV design and models. The division currently has 5 full-time researchers and a number of graduate researchers supporting the division while working closely with other divisions of ASDL.

## Mission Statement

1. Cultivate the next generation of aircraft designers through an internationally recognized, multidisciplinary educational program
2. Advance the state of the art in aircraft design through innovative MDAO methods incorporating system level analysis and high fidelity physic based simulations
