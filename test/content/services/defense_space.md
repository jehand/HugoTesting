The Defense and Space Division (D&S) has particular expertise in the application of advanced design methods to military strategic planning, design and operational challenges. Project areas include military modeling and simulation, system of systems, military operations analysis, C4ISR, manned and unmmaned aerial vehicles, naval systems, missile systems, ballistic missile defense, access-to-space vehicles, in-space transportation, space logistics, entry descent and landing, and hypersonics . Currently we have four full-time researchers and over 40 graduate researchers supporting the division while working closely with other divisions of ASDL.

## Mission Statement

To educate the future industry and government leaders of the defense and space community while improving the design and operation of defense and space systems through the use of innovative methods and techniques.

## Branch Functions
1. Defense Modeling and Simulation/Operations Analysis
    * Modeling and simulation is a key enabler to understanding how systems will interact and perform in scenarios of interest. Agent-based simulation (ABS), Discrete-Event simulation (DES), and System Dynamics (SD) have all become core capabilities in understanding how to design, deploy, and sustain systems in defense applications. Additionally, we consider operational effects from maintenance cycles and logistics chains to deployment schedules and surge capacity. These capabilities can be leveraged to deliver in-depth perspectives on design, acquisition, operation, and sustainment for defense applications. Our team also has experience generating, analyzing and visualizing relevant data to support key stakeholders and decision-makers as they seek to understand the problem of interest.

2. High Speed Atmospheric Vehicles
    * ASDL has a rich history of research in high speed systems. As we aspire to explore beyond our planet along with the desire to maintain a military advantage throughout the world, the need for research in the area of high speed systems is increasing. This includes, but is not limited to research in the area of entry descent and landing (EDL), launch vehicles, missiles, hypersonic vehicles, rocket propulsion, and air breathing propulsion. A large portion of this research is made possible by our hypersonic vehicle sizing and synthesis environment developed by ASDL research staff and students. The environment continues to evolve as new Ph.D. students continue to conduct research within the defense and space branch.

3. Space Systems
    * The space systems group applies ASDLâ€™s advanced methodologies to the design and analysis of space vehicles, missions, and architectures. Our goal is to provide the space community with the cutting-edge capabilities that enable systems analysis, multi-disciplinary optimization, and quantitative technology assessment. ASDL researchers and students have developed new methods for space vehicle sizing and synthesis, space architecture analysis, in-space trajectory optimization, space logistics, and in-space assembly.

4. Naval Systems
    * ASDL has a long and proud history of conducting research for naval entities. We have an in-house capability to conduct naval engineering analysis, further the development of naval research efforts, and transition methods and techniques from other engineering disciplines to the naval domain. Past work has included naval architecture and marine engineering, naval logistics/sea basing, autonomous naval systems, electric ship systems, and ship signatures.
